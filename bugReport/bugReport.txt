  Bug# 1
  Description:  When time manually changed in From Current Time popup selector - scroller doesn't change position accordingly
  Steps to reproduce:
     1. access impalaSource, "Scatter Plot" chart
     2. add timeBar pane with any time attribute
     3. Click on current FROM value container (class= tooltipDatePicker-content left) triangle arrow

  Bug# 2
  Description: UI bug, From Current Time container is not visible (hides under from container) when From and To Containers located really close
  Steps to reproduce:
     1. access impalaSource, "Scatter Plot" chart
     2. add timeBar pane with any time attribute
     3. with scroller change time to almost same, as FROM time
  Expected result: both current time value containers are visible for user
  Actual result: from container hides under TO container, so user is not able to know current FROM value

    Steps to reproduce:
       1. open any chart
       2. return to home page
       3. repeat points 1-2 several times
    Expected result: 1 html element representing side menu in html is expected to exist at any moment
